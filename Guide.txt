Fix structuree and liove option and etcs

Inside Sanity Make folder for each fetch function 

Inject groq 
(`
        *[
            _type == "product"
        ] | order(name asc) //Get all product
         
        { //define what info we needs
            _id,
            name,
            slug,
            mainImage {
                asset->,
                alt
            },
            description,

            stock,
